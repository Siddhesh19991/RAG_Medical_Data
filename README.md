# RAG_Medical_Data

This repository demonstrates the implementation of an RAG pipeline using Llama-3-8B. It is part of a comparative study between fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to determine which approach is more suitable for our use case.

The detailed blog can be found here.

RAG_medical.ipynb contains all the code necessary for setting up the RAG pipeline

### Dataset
For this project, we will be using publicly available medical data. This dataset is structured as prompt-completion pairs, where users ask medical questions and receive relevant responses from doctors.


Overview of the pipeline:
